README for pizza1_setup
Hopefully all the directories and most of the filenames you 
need show up in this setup.  If not, please follow the book's
names to make it clear what's what.

However the file contents are largely just copies of related
files from ch05_guitar_shop, so you need to rewrite them.

Please make sure you can run the project on topcat, because
that's where the grader will run it.  See database.php for
code that lets you run on topcat.
